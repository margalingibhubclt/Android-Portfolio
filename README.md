# BeatPlayer Music Application

This is my first application when i was learning android application developement, most of the things i implement in the application is custom means i almost try not to use 3rd party libraries because i wanted to learn more deep about low level apis of android.


Application will show you the all the songs which are available in your phone using content provider and at the same time it will create the service for the applciation so that you can easily play the music in the background and i use foreground service with notification which means you can also listen to your music even if you remove the application from the background.Application also offers you the albums where you have songs according to their albus so you can listen music based on the albums, also you can searn music in application. It also offers you the good user interface with animation so you will stick to use the application.

# Stry Application (Educational Application)

This application is still in developement and i was on contract based android application where i make quiz , statistics , overlay window and fix some errors in different sections of the app.

Application is for the students which contains questions in a quiz wrapped in a package, also teacher can create packages with number of questions in it's answer and those package will get converted in the quiz and these packages will be available in the package market in the application. There are other useful features in application like floating window where user can enable and give answer while he is outside of the application and other features like sharing packages and give review to packages.

# Storyfy Application

When i was working in company as a intern, i build this application which is basically a story telling application where you story coming from server and you can choose your choice in order turn story in your direction.

Application uses firebase to store stories and also it show different twist according to user choice. It has a quite simple user internface with some animation, application will upload new stories as they completing writing the stories by writer and user does not need to update the application in order to read new contents. I have use custom user interface because requiements is to make app more like a book so we have made the custom drawable and view to perform this action.

You can use single paper to control the game, you just need to show paper in front of camera and move to different direction in order to control the game.
This application is using the opencv for performing computer vision algorithms it is used to caputure the color and also calcualte of distance where paper is moved and then converting coordinate into game coordinate and press the butttons for controlling the game.
